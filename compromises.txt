* List of things that are not happening
    - No authentication and authorization
    - console.log instead of log library
    - Writing to res in the routes, not handling in more graceful way

* List of things that can happen better
    - Better Error handling
    - Handling possible long list for carriers with pagination / search
    - Probably more coherent styling handling
